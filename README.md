# jellyfish

Stream of consciousness writing repository. The point of jellyfish is to make the writing and maintaining of notes painless. Less clutter and thought concerning the medium, more thought about the writing.

Important note: Jellyfish is intentionally feature-minimal and ridiculously basic. For now each entry has exactly two fields: an owner and a blob of content.

Supports markdown and will eventually have a robust API for accessing public entries.
